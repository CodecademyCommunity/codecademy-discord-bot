Every great Discord server needs a great bot, so we coded up our own. It does a lot of things that other bots do, plus has a few tailored commands.

## Other Functionality

- **Logging Deleted Messages:** the bot checks when users delete their messages and creates a log of it. This hopefully helps moderating channels where users try to circumvent typical moderation by spamming and immediately deleting their messages.

- **Logging Command Usage:** the bot logs the usage of moderation commands (ban, kick, mute, etc.) and stores this information in a MySQL database.
